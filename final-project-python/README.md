Read the Substitution cipher from wikipedia.
We'll create a program that can:

-  create encryption keys, convert them to decryption keys
- save and load keys to files (ex:  my-key.key)
- accept a clear-text file and encrypt it using an encryption key
- Accept an encrypted file, and decrypt.

There is always the "current key"  (the created, or loaded key)
You should write a CLI (command line interface) that a user can use to support all of these actions (see example file).
Programming instructions:
* Create a directory called "enc" under python
* Write a modular program, with different modules for specific tasks; For example:
	* an subs module to handle the cli
	* enckey file to handle the creation of keys
* Your main file should be called subs.pi
* All code should be placed inside functions, except ONE line that should call the entry function
* Small functions, each function should do just ONE thing, good and meaningful names...
* You cannot submit files, your code should be in your git repository,
